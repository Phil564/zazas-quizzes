## Quick Disclaimer: If you want to publish an edited version of this game, then please credit me. I don't care if I rushed it and if it's pretty simple, but i still made it.

# Zaza's Quizzes
A short Roblox Game I made as a Science project. This was a group project, and I was with 3 of my friends. However, it was only me who was handling the game. They only made the questions that are included in the game. As I am in a french school, this project was designed to be in french. However, a english version might come out one day.

The original name of the game was "Atomic Classroom". I thought of "Molecular Madness", but they didn't really like the name (for some odd reason???) On the 13th of October 2022, I suggested to change the name to "Zaza's Quizzes", and they agreed (and they went on to say "who the fuck made the game's name Atomic Classroom????").

I might remake this in Unity one day since you need to have the FiB v16 studio client to play this (because I made this with the intensions to run this game offline).

## How 2 play
(btw those are steps so do them in the right order.)
- First of all, you'll need the FiB v16 Roblox Studio Client. Get it from [here](https://github.com/Roblox/future-is-bright/releases/tag/v16).
- Download the latest release on the release page.
- Place the `custom-AC` folder from the archive you downloaded in the `content` folder of the Studio client.
- Start the Studio client **offline**. You **need** to start it offline, as the client will then try to connect to the roblox servers. When starting it offline, it will boot you up in the Menu.
- Drag the latest version of the game in the Studio Client's window. The one which has the highest number.
- Have fun! (don't forget that this game is NOT in english yet.)

## Assets used in the project
Here is a list of assets I "borrowed" from the internet. I probably do not have the right to put those assets in my project, but hey, I ain't gonna sell this or anything. (oh and there are also some modern Roblox assets I downloaded from the website, so those won't be linked)

- The Google "Correct and Wrong" sounds.
